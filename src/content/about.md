# About Bottled Happiness

This our entry for the [GatsbyJS #SillySiteChallenge](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/silly-site-challenge/).

It's a work in progress, but the idea is to bottle up kids laughter to spread some happiness at the end of 2020.

All work is done in the open, check out the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/raae/bottledhappiness).

## Who are we?

We are Lilly Labs, a family owned web-shop.

- Benedicte ([@raae](https://twitter.com/raae)) is the mom and senior developer.
- Ola ([@olaholstvea](https://twitter.com/olaholstvea)) is the dad and junior developer evangelist.
- Lillian (6 ðŸ¦„) is the Intern.

We work as independent contractors and indie hackers.

Our current focus is [POW!](https://usepow.app) â€” the privacy-first menstrual cycle journal.

Sign up for @raae's [weekly newsletter](https://lillylabs.ck.page/67d6b9ca5d) to be updated on our life as Indie Hackers including monthly POW! Status Updates.
